# Hybrid File Compression: Huffman + LZ77

This project demonstrates a hybrid text compression system combining **Huffman coding** and **LZ77 compression** to achieve effective lossless data compression.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `HybridCompression.py` – Main script containing compression/decompression logic  
- `test2.txt` – Original uncompressed text (sample input)  
- `comp.bin` – Compressed binary file generated from test2.txt  
- `output1.png` – Output visual (e.g., size comparison chart - optional)  
- `output2.png` – Output visual (e.g., compression ratio or flowchart - optional)

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- Huffman Coding
- LZ77 Compression
- Pickle (for serialization)
- Bitwise Manipulation

## 💡 How It Works

### 1. LZ77 Compression
- The input text is tokenized using LZ77-style references.
- Tokens are encoded into a bit string.

### 2. Huffman Coding
- The token bit string is then compressed using Huffman encoding.
- Results in further reduction by encoding frequent patterns with shorter codes.

### 3. Decompression
- Huffman decoding is performed first.
- Then LZ77 decoding reconstructs the original content.

## 🛠️ Usage

> Run from terminal or command prompt:

### 🔹 Compression

```bash
python HybridCompression.py
# Then enter:
# Enter mode (c for compress, d for decompress): c
# Enter the path to the file to compress: test2.txt
# Enter the path for the compressed output (e.g., comp.bin): comp.bin
```
### 🔹 DEcompression
```bash
python HybridCompression.py
# Then enter:
# Enter mode (c for compress, d for decompress): d
# Enter the path to the compressed file (e.g., comp.bin): comp.bin
# Enter the path for the decompressed output (e.g., output.txt): output.txt
```
📊 Results
Original File Size: test2.txt → ~92 KB

Compressed File Size: comp.bin → ~71 KB

✅ ~23% size reduction achieved using the hybrid model.

Visuals: output1.png, output2.png

✅ Features
✅ Lossless compression

✅ Handles large text inputs

✅ Hybrid model for better space optimization

✅ Simple interface via terminal

📌 Note
test2.txt contains educational theory content and is used here as a test input.

Ensure your input file is in UTF-8 format.
